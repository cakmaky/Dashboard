# Dashboard
I created a small Dashboard app that

• Makes an internet request that returns JSON data listing the 100 most popular paid iOS apps on the iTunes App Store

• Parses the JSON data into an NSDictionary

• Retrieves the titles of the 100 apps from the NSDictionary

• Outputs the titles and app rankings to the Debugging Console

• Displays the retrieved data in a Tab Bar Controller app
